    <h1>Privacy Policy for Sokoban Mobile Game</h1>

    <p><strong>Last Updated: [Date, e.g., May 28, 2025]</strong></p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Sokoban Mobile Game ("we," "us," or "our") handles information in connection with the mobile application Sokoban Mobile Game (the "App").</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>

    <p>We understand the importance of your privacy. Sokoban Mobile Game is designed to be a simple and enjoyable game experience. As such:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>No Personal Data:</strong> The App does not collect, store, use, or share any personally identifiable information (PII) from its users. This includes, but is not limited to, your name, email address, phone number, location, device identifiers, or any other data that could be used to identify you.</li>
        <li><strong>No Usage Data:</strong> The App does not track your usage patterns, gameplay statistics (beyond what might be stored locally on your device for game progress, if applicable, and not transmitted to us), or any other analytical data about how you interact with the App that is sent to us or third parties.</li>
        <li><strong>No Login Required:</strong> The App does not require you to create an account, log in, or provide any personal details to play.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How Information is Handled (Locally)</h2>

    <p>If the App saves game progress (such as completed levels or current game state), this information is stored <strong>solely on your local device</strong>. This data is not transmitted to us or any third parties and is under your control. Clearing the App's data or uninstalling the App will typically remove this locally stored information.</p>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>

    <p>Sokoban Mobile Game does not integrate with any third-party services that would collect personal information from you through your use of the App (e.g., analytics services, advertising networks, social media logins).</p>

    <h2>4. Children's Privacy</h2>

    <p>Since the App does not collect any personal information, it is inherently safe for users of all ages, including children. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 (or the relevant age of consent in your jurisdiction).</p>

    <h2>5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the App or on our app store listing. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted.</p>

    <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us <a href="mailto:hiredintech@gmail.com">by email</a>.</p>
